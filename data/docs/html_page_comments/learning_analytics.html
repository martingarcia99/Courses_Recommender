<br>All is good.
<br>Content is presented in a very short time, so maybe longer lectures or less content.
<br>Course and lecturer are more than perfect. Contents are really good. Because of the unbalanced groups (some are strong, some not) we may get a low level grade.
<br>I am in my first semester, so it was really important for me that this course could help me to be more familiar with new areas. Also is makes me motivated to follow
<br>this area.
<br>I like combinations of practical and theoretical sessions. Best lecture in the uni for Masters Computer Engineering.
<br>I liked the practical application of knowledge very much. It would be really good, if each person's activity was tracked in the group because some people don't show
<br>and interest and don't contribute to the group.
<br>I liked the visualization part, which was the last. Machine learning part was described in 3 days, which doesn't help students to be able to create models.
<br>I really liked the lectures, but I did not like the project. The project was too much work.
<br>ML algorithms should be more in practice. I don't see and help of recommendation systen (student presentation). As a student we can present ML libraries with
<br>samples, but not in groups.
<br>More examples, especially for final project and fulfilling it's requirement is neccessary, thanks.
<br>One problem is that this course need a lot of group work, but some group members have more experience of the contents learned in this course than other group
<br>members.
<br>Participating and questioning.
<br>Selecting the groups, start with the project idea earlier. One of the best courses so far.
<br>The group work is difficult to deal if the groups are bigger than 3 people.
<br>The project part which have differnet oppotunity to choose the tools was really good because depends on our konowledge.
<br>The visualiziation part was clear enough and the recommendation part was also interesting. This lecture helped me a lot and increased my knowledge using
<br>programming apps.
<br>This course can be challenging for new students who have no knowledge about any of the topics. The course is very applied and I would recommend that the Prof.
<br>can decide strictly at the beginning class about the students past experience. Also team selection should be done by the students.
<br>Very informative and interesting content. Helped a lot in terms of designs and visualizations.
