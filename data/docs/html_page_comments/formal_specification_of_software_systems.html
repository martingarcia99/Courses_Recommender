He involved himself with students by asking questions and relating it with programming logics.
<br>I don't know where I will use it in the future.
<br>I liked the Professor's involvement in students but her methodology of teaching is not sufficient enough for understanding.
<br>I missed the first lecture and everything was out of my understanding (not in lectures, but in exercises.
<br>I think the assignment is so difficult, I need to spend too much time to do it every week.
<br>I want the teacher to upload the correct answer of the exercise.
<br>I'd like to see material or slides of the lecture in Moodle, maybe it can help me understand some key points.
<br>Just one example to define and present the schema is not sufficient, but it's my opinion.
<br>Lectures and exercises don't sync in my opinion. Assignments are a little bit different from lecture.
<br>Make it more practicable.
<br>Maybe everything about this course will be clear and understandable at the end of the course because i see a lot of ambiguity things in the lecture.
<br>The exercise course explains the exercise very clearly. I wish the handwriting in the lecture could be more recognizable.
<br>The notions are not clear (most of them). How to use them and the lecture is poor with the examples given from the lecturer.
<br>The teacher writes the knowledge on the blackboard, so I can understand very good. It's the best!
<br>Videorecording would be helpful if students cannot attend, therefore change from blackboard to digital Noteblock and record.
