<br>Can be improved by giving task like in CRV
<br>I don't really clear know, how to use knowledge to deal with industriell problem, how to use it study in the future studying?
<br>I think for master studies it should be enough to tell the algorithm in a few minutes and not in 20 minutes
<br>I think the topics are way to basic, it would be much better to go more into detail than explaining very basic things so long (Jacobi matrix, path finding)
<br>It could be better if we can really operate/handle the real problems
<br>It was impossible at the beginning of the semester to have a seat inside the classroom
<br>It's better if the practical part have slides that the coordinator explain it not just tasks
<br>It's sad that we do not go into more detail
<br>New algorithms and clear representation of tough topics
<br>No bonus point -&gt; this doesn't encourage the student
<br>Practice with Ros every week
<br>Prof Pauli is very creative when explaining complex topics, he constantly uses real life examples and uses also different tools in order to explain abstract topics
<br>Prof Pauli's teaching is great!
<br>Sehr gut
<br>Slides of the lecture are well understandable
<br>Some basic information in the course are very detailed explained, in my opinion it could be faster
<br>The amount of people inside made it very difficult and uncomfortable to pay attention
<br>The contents of the presentation are presented in a clear way
<br>The exercises in the practice are solveable with the given material but a presentation in addition the the exercises would be helpful
<br>The lecture can be fasterr and not always repeating known basics, e.g. Jacobi matrix, basic controller
<br>The lecturer is a bit slow in explaining, practical part ahouls have homeworks
<br>The practical exercise is too much content/time, other than that it's great!
<br>The practical part is catastrophe
<br>The practical part is not intersting (Praktikum)
<br>The practical part is very good
<br>The practicals are not made clear, many concepts have to be learned alone, few support from the Lehrstuhl
<br>The room for the class should be appropiate for the amount of students
<br>The short summary at the beginning of every lesson helps us to keep up with the amaount of information that we recieve each class
<br>There are a little relationship with the control theory from other courses, that's exciting! Perhaps the content of the course can be deeper and weiter
<br>There is no multiple choice question online on moodle
<br>There is room for improvement during the practical exercise
<br>Too cryptical, more KI
<br>Very good slides, time management is appropiate, exercise is pretty difficult
<br>We need more assistance during the practical task executed
<br>Working with ROS ist great and more emphasis should be laid on a similar program
